# source-renderer
A lightweight lib for UI render and keep the state of app in one object

## Ideas:
- Developer have to decide when the components should be re-rendered
- Keep the source (the input) reference throw multiple component layers (very useful when you have to store the state into storage)
- Immutability, use or not is your style

## Document (To be update)
- Please look the test folder for example
